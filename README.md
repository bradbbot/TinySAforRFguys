By Brad Baisley with contribution from Jason Glass

--

This is a Windows Powershell script which converts CSV files generated by TinySA-App into a CSV format useable in the coordination tab of Shure Wireless Workbench and in PWS IAS wireless microphone coordination software.

TinySAtoIAS makes CSV's compatible with IAS and WWB
TinySAtoWWB makes CSV's only compatible with Shure Wireless Workbench and will be deprecated. 


Instructions:
-Open TinytoIASfix.ps1 in a text editor like Notepad, Notepad++ or Powershell ISE
-Edit the input file path to the CSV generated by TinySA-APP one spot at the top of the script C:\PATHTOYOUR\INPUTFILENAME.csv
-Edit the output file path to wherever you would like the new file be deposited.  There are 4 places at the bottom of the script which need to all have the same path specified - C:\PATHTOYOUR\OUTPUTFILENAME.csv 
-Save TinytoIASfix.ps1 

-Open tinytowwb.bat in a text editor
-change the path to whereyour TinytoIASfix.ps1 is located C:\PATHTOYOUR\TinytoIASfix.ps1
-Save

-Double click tinytoIAS.bat and the file you have pointed it to should be processed and outputted to the file location and name you specified.

-Alternatively you can just right click on your updated TinytoIASfix.ps1 and select 'Run with PowerShell.'

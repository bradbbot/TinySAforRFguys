TinySA to WWB and IAS Convertor
By Brad Baisley with contribution from Jason Glass

--

This is a Windows Powershell script which converts CSV files generated by TinySA-App into a CSV format useable in the coordination tab of Shure Wireless Workbench and in PWS IAS wireless microphone coordination software.

TinySA4RFDialog is a GUI front end for a Windows Powershell script which converts the CSV.   

TinySAtoIAS and TinySAtoWWB are previous versions which require modification to the users needs and do not include any correction for the amplitude export bug.

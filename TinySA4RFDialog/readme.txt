TinySA CSV Convertor for Wireless Workbench and IAS
By Brad Baisley with contribution from Jason Glass

--

This is a Windows Powershell script packaged as a Windows executeable which converts CSV files generated by TinySA-App into a CSV format that can be imported into both Shure Wireless Workbench and Professional Wireless Systems IAS wireless microphone frequency coordination software.  It also corrects for the bug (discovered by Jason Glass) in TinySA-App which exports the CSV with decreased amplitude.   

Instructions:
-Download TinySA4RF.exe
-Double Click TinySA4RF.exe
-A dialog appears where the csv exported by TinySA-app is selected
-After clicking convert a new CSV file is generated in the same folder where the source file is located.   The new file is renamed adding WWB and the time/date when the csv was generated.

Note: TinySA4RF.ps1 is the underlying powershell script and is included for anyone who would like to modify it to suit their needs.
